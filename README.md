## 1. Spiking Neural Network
   The purpose of this project is to viusalize how learning works in brain. Initially, neural network was inspired by biological neuron connectivy. But, as it aims for the efficiency, which promises its speed and accuracy, it ran away from its intial inspiration. This is the reason why I choosed to take a close look for spiking neural network.

   Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a biologically inspired form of artificial neural network that uses neuron firing (spikes) and temporal information to process data. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs operate with discrete events, making them efficient for handling time-varying data.
